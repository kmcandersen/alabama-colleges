# ALABAMA COLLEGE BUILDING PROGRAM

This website is an interactive version of the senior thesis I completed for my B.A. in History from Auburn University, about a planning and construction program at nine Alabama college campuses from 1928-1930. The website includes an [interactive map](https://kristenandersen.online/al-colleges/#auburn-map) showing the plan proposed for Auburn, completed buildings, and the modern campus, created and hosted on [ArcGIS Online](https://www.esri.com/en-us/arcgis/products/arcgis-online/overview). In early 2021, I upgraded the website to Bootstrap 5 and added performance and accessibility improvements.
